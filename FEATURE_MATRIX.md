# OMP Desktop Feature and Surface Matrix

This matrix is the parity contract. T3 Code is the presentation and interaction reference. OMP is the behavioral authority. A feature is not complete because a button exists; the listed runtime state, transitions, errors, permissions, and proof must work.

## 1. Hosts, connections, and environments

| Capability | OMP authority | T3 reference | Desktop surface and required states | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Local host discovery | `packages/coding-agent/src/modes/rpc/rpc-mode.ts`, planned appserver health/capabilities | `apps/web/src/routes/__root.tsx`, `packages/client-runtime/src/connection/*` | Host switcher; starting, ready, version-skew, unavailable, reconnecting, read-only, upgrade-required | Launch |
| Remote tailnet host | Existing collab transport plus planned appserver; current Mac/bunker topology | `packages/tailscale/src/tailscale.ts`, `packages/ssh/src/tunnel.ts`, connection supervisor | Add by MagicDNS/IP, pair, trust, connect, revoke, latency/status; never expose tokens | Launch |
| Host capability negotiation | Planned versioned app protocol over OMP runtime | T3 contract schemas and server handshake | Show feature compatibility; disable unsupported actions with reason | Launch |
| Multi-host operation | Planned appserver registry | T3 environments/projects | Sessions grouped by host and project; host status remains visible across switches | Launch |

## 7. Files, review, terminal, browser, and developer surfaces

| Surface | T3 implementation reference | OMP data/control | Required states |
|---|---|---|---|
| Right-panel families | `rightPanelStore.ts`, `RightPanelTabs.tsx`, `RightPanelSheet.tsx` | protocol surface registry | Five persistent families: Agents, Activity, Review, Files, Terminal; open/close/reorder/select/restore per session; context is a composer popover/dialog and raw events are Activity filters |

## 8. Models, providers, authentication, and usage

The desktop reads typed data from OMP settings/model/provider registries. It never reads or displays secret values.

- Provider inventory, health, account labels, model inventory, capabilities, pricing metadata, service tier, quota/usage, and error status.
- Role routing: main, smol, slow, plan, advisor, reviewer, direct named model, and current session override.
- Provider setup/login/logout flows use OMP-owned auth APIs and browser/deep-link callbacks.
- Auth broker state is status-only; token contents never cross the protocol.
- Custom provider/model configuration uses schema-generated controls with secret references, not raw secret text.
- Model switching validates capability compatibility before changing the live session.
- Usage views include per-turn/session/day/provider/model tokens, cost where known, cached tokens, request count, and resets supported by `/usage`.

Authority paths: `config/settings.ts`, `settings-schema.ts`, `models-config-schema.ts`, `model-registry.ts`, provider capability registry, auth broker/client code, `packages/stats`.

## 9. Tools and extensibility

### Built-in tool catalog

The appserver exposes the active tool catalog from `tools/index.ts` and `tools/builtin-names.ts`. Initial known names are:

`read`, `bash`, `edit`, `ast_grep`, `ast_edit`, `ask`, `debug`, `eval`, `ssh`, `github`, `find/search`, `lsp`, `inspect_image`, `browser`, `checkpoint`, `rewind`, `task`, `job`, `irc`, `todo`, `web_search`, `search_tool_bm25`, `write`, `memory_edit`, `retain`, `recall`, `reflect`, `learn`, `manage_skill`; plus hidden/runtime tools `yield`, `report_finding`, `report_tool_issue`, `resolve`, and `goal` when enabled.

For every tool: show availability, source, description, running calls, validated input/result, permission class, artifacts, error, and raw fallback. Tool-specific renderers are enhancements over the generic structured renderer, never separate backend implementations.

### Extensibility inventory

| Capability | Authority | Desktop surface |
|---|---|---|
| MCP servers/tools/resources | `mcp/client.ts`, manager/config, `/mcp` | servers list, transport/health/tools, add/test/remove, logs, secret-safe config |
| Extensions/plugins | `extensibility/extensions/loader.ts`, types, `/extensions`, `/plugins` | installed/enabled/source/version/errors; enable/disable/reload |
| Marketplace | `/marketplace` | sources, search, details, install/update/remove with permission warning |
| Skills | `extensibility/skills.ts` | user/project/managed sources, inspect, enable/disable where supported, managed-skill operations |
| Agents | registry and `/agents` | bundled/user/project agents, model/role/source, availability |
| Commands | builtin registry plus extension commands | searchable command palette and slash autocomplete |
| Custom tools/hooks | extension API/shared events | inventory, source, enabled state, failure logs |
| Tool discovery | discovery mode/search index | active vs discoverable counts and search action |
| Reload | `/reload-plugins` | atomic reload progress/result; preserve current session on failure |

## 10. Memory, context, rules, and autonomous modes

| Capability | Authority | Desktop contract |
|---|---|---|
| Recall/reflect/retain/learn/edit | Mnemopi tools and `packages/mnemopi` | Memory search/list/detail/source, create/update/invalidate/forget confirmations, fact read-only state |
| Memory maintenance | `/memory` subcommands | status/health/refresh/history/maintenance results; advanced surface |
| Context files | capability/context loaders and `AGENTS.md` discovery | Show applied files/source/scope and reload state; content visibility respects filesystem authority |
| Skills/rules | skill and rule loaders | Show what influenced current session and source precedence |
| TTSR/OMFG | `export/ttsr.ts`, `/omfg` | Rule creation/review, trigger event, stream abort/retry ancestry, enable/disable |
| Checkpoint/rewind | checkpoint tools | Named checkpoint state, rewind preview/confirmation, current-history impact |
| Goal/guided goal/loop | goal state/runtime and slash commands | Objective/progress/yield/iteration controls and persistent status |
| Advisor/plan/review | respective mode state and commands | Distinct authorship, state, review actions, timeout/error |

## 11. Settings, diagnostics, and desktop lifecycle

Settings UI is generated from OMP's typed `settings-schema.ts` and supplemental model/provider schemas. This avoids a second hand-maintained settings universe and guarantees new OMP settings appear with an unsupported-control fallback rather than disappearing.

Required classes and behavior:

- Scope: global, project, session override, CLI overlay, read-only effective value.
- Type: boolean, enum, number, duration, text, path, list, map, secret reference, nested object.
- State: default/inherited/overridden, invalid, restart-required, unavailable on host/platform, sensitive.
- Actions: edit, reset scope, reveal source path—not secret value—reload, validate, export redacted diagnostics.
- Dedicated surfaces: general, appearance, models/providers, roles, tools/discovery, MCP, extensions/plugins, agents/skills, memory, keybindings/hotkeys, notifications, speech, browser, terminal, remote hosts, updates, diagnostics.
- App lifecycle: window state, native titlebar, menu, deep links, protocol URLs, notifications, tray optional, update download/apply, crash recovery, safe restart, release notes.

## 12. Visual system and accessibility contract

- Light and dark only; neutral surfaces dominate.
- Pi Pink `#e83174` is reserved for brand mark, focus/selection when not conflicting with semantic state, primary commit action, and active OMP identity. It is not a background wash or decorative gradient.
- Success/warning/error/info use separate accessible semantic colors; pink never means both brand and warning in the same context; warning stays semantic amber.
- Existing OMP pi/connector mark from `assets/icon.svg` is adapted for light/dark and desktop icon sizes.
- All status has icon/text/shape, never color alone.
- Full keyboard navigation, visible focus, screen-reader names, reduced motion, scalable type, IME, and minimum-window fallback. Text meets WCAG AA; focus/selection rings meet WCAG 1.4.11 non-text 3:1 against both surface and adjacent fill.

## 13. Explicit CLI-only boundaries

These remain CLI-only only when the desktop cannot preserve authority or fidelity:

- Raw terminal escape-sequence presentation and terminal-specific debug probes.
- Shell profile editing and arbitrary credential-file editing.
- Provider secret value display.
- Unsafe plugin source mutation without an OMP-owned validated command.
- Internal developer commands with no stable non-TUI handler until OMP exposes one.

CLI-only is not silent omission. The desktop shows the capability, explains why it opens a terminal or is unavailable, and provides the exact safe transition.
