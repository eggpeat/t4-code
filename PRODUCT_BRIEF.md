# OMP Desktop Product Brief

## Product

A Linux/macOS desktop client for OMP. Preserve OMP as the agent runtime; make projects, concurrent sessions, live streaming, tools, terminal activity, subagents, reviews, files, settings, and remote hosts easier to see and operate.

## Primary reference

T3 Code at `reference/t3code` is the primary presentation, interaction, desktop-shell, and implementation reference. Its MIT license permits copying and modification with attribution. Use direct adaptation where it accelerates quality; do not reimplement equivalent primitives without a reason.

## Experience target

- Presentation and perceived performance are product-critical.
- Keyboard-first, dense when useful, calm by default.
- Fast project/session switching with preserved scroll, composer, panel, and draft state.
- Center session stream remains the primary surface.
- Optional right pane extends the T3 pattern with five calm surface families: Agents, Activity (including events), Review, Files, and user Terminal. Context is a popover/dialog, not a permanent tab.
- Browser/app preview is required before parity closure, but opens as a focused preview workspace or secondary Electron window rather than becoming a sixth permanent right-pane family.
- Light and dark themes use neutral surfaces. Accent use is minimal and semantic.
- OMP identity uses the existing pi/connector mark from the upstream Oh My Pi repository and the Pi Pink `#e83174` accent.
- No SVG turbulence, paper-grain, noise texture, or equivalent decorative overlay is imported from T3.

## Runtime boundary

- OMP remains authoritative for models, tools, commands, sessions, task agents, memory, skills, settings, auth, and execution.
- The desktop app consumes a versioned OMP app protocol; it does not parse terminal pixels as its primary data source and does not reimplement OMP behavior.
- A persistent OMP appserver runs on an OMP host, supports local desktop attachment, and supports authenticated remote attachment across the user's Tailscale tailnet.
- Remote control must preserve exact session identity, reconnect/replay semantics, capability authorization, and explicit destructive-action boundaries.

## Planned package boundaries

- `apps/desktop`: Electron main/preload, packaging, updates, OS integration.
- `apps/web`: T3-derived React renderer and desktop/web client shell.
- `packages/protocol`: install the checked-in relative app-wire tarball from `vendor/app-wire/`, verify its manifest/checksums, re-export it, and add desktop-only IPC schemas without redeclaring network frames.
- `packages/client`: connection, replay, cache, optimistic-state rules, host/session stores.
- `packages/ui`: T3-derived design primitives, tokens, icons, motion, virtualization.
- `packages/fixture-server`: deterministic seeded sessions, faults, and load scenarios.
- OMP `packages/app-wire`: sole versioned, dependency-free protocol authority with JSON-safe TypeScript types, executable decoders/guards, constants, and golden frames.
- OMP `packages/appserver`: persistent host service, RPC-child supervisor, local socket, remote endpoint, pairing, policy, replay, PTY, files, and audit.

## Proof standard

Behavior is proven with deterministic contract tests, concurrency and reconnect stress, seeded visual states, screenshot comparison, interaction/motion checks, Linux runtime proof, macOS runtime proof, and a real two-host Tailscale smoke before remote functionality is called complete.
