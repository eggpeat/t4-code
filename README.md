# T4 Code

T4 Code is a free, open-source (MIT) desktop app for [Oh My Pi](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi) (OMP), made for people who live in OMP all day. OMP runs your coding sessions; T4 Code shows them and lets you steer. The app never owns runtime state. It mirrors what the OMP host reports and sends your actions back as commands. It's a ROYCORP project.

[**Download v0.1.0**](https://github.com/LycaonLLC/t4-code/releases/tag/v0.1.0) · [**Docs**](https://t4code.net/docs) · [**Get the source**](#build-from-source)

## Requirements

T4 Code needs an OMP build with desktop appserver support. Install OMP first: <https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi>.

| Platform | Arch | Package |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Linux | x86_64 | `.deb`, AppImage |
| macOS | Apple Silicon (arm64) | `.dmg`, `.zip` (**unsigned, see below**) |

No Windows build and no Intel Mac build in v0.1.0.

## Install

### Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)

```sh
wget https://github.com/LycaonLLC/t4-code/releases/download/v0.1.0/T4-Code-0.1.0-linux-amd64.deb
sudo apt install ./T4-Code-0.1.0-linux-amd64.deb
```

Use `apt install` rather than `dpkg -i` so system dependencies resolve automatically.

### Linux (AppImage)

```sh
wget https://github.com/LycaonLLC/t4-code/releases/download/v0.1.0/T4-Code-0.1.0-linux-x86_64.AppImage
chmod +x T4-Code-0.1.0-linux-x86_64.AppImage
./T4-Code-0.1.0-linux-x86_64.AppImage
```

### macOS (Apple Silicon)

> [!WARNING]
> **The macOS v0.1.0 build is unsigned and unnotarized.** Apple has not checked it, and Gatekeeper will block it with a "damaged" or "unidentified developer" message. Only continue if you trust this repository. You can always build from source instead.

1. Download [`T4-Code-0.1.0-mac-arm64.dmg`](https://github.com/LycaonLLC/t4-code/releases/download/v0.1.0/T4-Code-0.1.0-mac-arm64.dmg) (or [`T4-Code-0.1.0-mac-arm64.zip`](https://github.com/LycaonLLC/t4-code/releases/download/v0.1.0/T4-Code-0.1.0-mac-arm64.zip)).
2. Drag `T4 Code.app` into `/Applications`.
3. Remove the quarantine flag:

   ```sh
   xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/T4 Code.app"
   ```

   Or right-click the app in Finder, choose **Open**, then **Open** again in the prompt.

## What the app does

- **Sessions.** Browse projects and sessions on a host, create new ones, and switch between them. Recently used sessions stay warm, so switching back is instant and nothing is replayed twice.
- **Composer.** Send prompts, use slash commands (`/model`, `/compact`, `/retry`, `/review`, `/terminal`, and more), and change the session's model, thinking level, or fast mode inline.
- **Panes.** Watch subagents (and cancel them), apply reviews, browse and preview files on the host, and attach to live terminals with real keyboard input and resize.
- **Settings.** Edit host settings over the wire. Drafts stage locally and only apply when the host confirms; a dropped connection never silently writes anything.
- **Keyboard.** `Ctrl/Cmd+K` search, `Ctrl/Cmd+B` sidebar, `Ctrl/Cmd+1..9` session switch, `Ctrl/Cmd+,` settings. Every workflow is keyboard-operable.

Some actions depend on what the host supports. When a host can't do something (steer a single agent, discard a review, read a file), the control shows as disabled with the reason instead of pretending.

## Local and paired hosts

**Local.** T4 Code looks for the `omp` executable via `$OMP_EXECUTABLE`, your `PATH`, and common install locations (`~/.local/bin`, `/usr/local/bin`, `/opt/omp/bin`, ...). It then manages the appserver for you: a systemd user service on Linux, a launch agent on macOS. Appserver logs land in `~/.local/state/t4-code/appserver` (Linux) or `~/Library/Logs/T4 Code/appserver` (macOS).

**Paired.** Connect to an OMP host on another machine through a `t4-code://pair/...` link generated on that host. Device credentials are encrypted with your OS keychain (Electron `safeStorage`) before they touch disk. Dropped connections reconnect automatically with backoff, and any settings you had staged stay staged until the host confirms.

## First run

1. Install and start OMP on the machine you want to work on.
2. Launch T4 Code. On the same machine, it finds `omp` and offers to start the appserver. For another machine, open the pairing link from that host.
3. Pick a project, pick or create a session, and start working.

## Build from source

Needs Node `^24.13.1` and pnpm `11.10.0`.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/LycaonLLC/t4-code.git
cd t4-code
pnpm install
pnpm dev              # web + desktop in watch mode
pnpm check            # structure, provenance, lint, typecheck
pnpm test             # workspace tests
pnpm package:linux    # .deb + AppImage into release/
pnpm package:mac:unsigned  # unsigned macOS build (on a Mac)
```

## Architecture

```
apps/desktop   Electron main process: window, local omp discovery,
               appserver lifecycle, pairing, credential storage
apps/web       React UI (Vite): sessions, composer, panes, settings
packages/      client, protocol, remote, service-manager, ui
```

The UI talks to an OMP host over typed WebSocket frames (`omp-app/1`, via the vendored `@oh-my-pi/app-wire`). State flows host → app as frames; user actions flow app → host as commands. The app projects what it receives and never fabricates state.
